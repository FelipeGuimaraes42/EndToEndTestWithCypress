In this case I was expecting two tests, but the test that I uploaded on git was not edited.
It saved it in one test. Better than I thought!

**CONTEXT**
Answer like a software engineer.
I have the HTML below and I want you to create an E2E test case for it using Cypress syntax. The answer must be ONLY
code, you donâ€™t need to explain it.

**CODE EXPLANATION**
The code ahead is an HTML fragment of an application very similar to Jira.

**CODE**
*Filter buttons*
<button class="sc-bwzfXH jYbwSu sc-gzOgki gLPSFk">
    <div class="sc-bxivhb rljZq">Only My Issues</div>
</button>
<button class="sc-bwzfXH jYbwSu sc-gzOgki gLPSFk">
    <div class="sc-bxivhb rljZq">Recently Updated</div>
</button>

*Board*
<div class="sc-hrWEMg efIbEb">
    ...
</div>

*My card (inside board)*
<div class="sc-kPVwWT eYJELZ">
    <p class="sc-kfGgVZ duybNU">Each issue has a single reporter but can have multiple assignees.</p>
</div>

*Not my card (inside board)*
<div class="sc-kPVwWT eYJELZ">
    <p class="sc-kfGgVZ duybNU">Click on an issue to see what's behind it.</p>
</div>

**TEST CASES REQUEST**
I want you to create a test in Cypress syntax for each of the following use cases:
1) As a user, I should be able to filter only cards that are assigned to me.

**OBSERVATIONS**
Url is https://jira.ivorreic.com/project/board
Wait 15 seconds after the page loads.
Use text for getting components, as id is not unique
Verify, after clicking on the board, that my card is there and the card that is not mine, is not

---------------

Another use case: As a user, I should be able to clear all filters and click on another one.

For this use case, clear filters and then click on recent updated button. The card that wasn't appearing before should appear again.

The clear filter button is:
*Clear Filters*
<div class="sc-iyvyFf eWAgnI">Clear all</div>
