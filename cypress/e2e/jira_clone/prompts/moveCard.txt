Even with all attempts below, I couldn't get the right test.
The original test is not easy to understand: https://github.com/oldboyxx/jira_clone/blob/master/client/cypress/integration/issuesDragDrop.spec.js

In theory, the test does what it was supposed to do: open card, verify its status, return, click on it, drag it, release it and verify its status.
But something about the implementation doesn't let it be dragged.

**CONTEXT**
Answer like a software engineer.
I have the HTML below and I want you to create an E2E test case for it using Cypress syntax. The answer must be ONLY
code, you don’t need to explain it.

**CODE EXPLANATION**
The code ahead is the HTML demonstration of an application very similar to Jira. The following HTML fragments represent the selected card, and after clicking, the card description.

**CODE**
*Card on Home*
<div class="sc-kPVwWT eYJELZ">
    <p class="sc-kfGgVZ duybNU">Try dragging issues to different columns to transition their status.</p>
    <div class="sc-esjQYD DdvSq">
        <div><i color="story" size="18" class="sc-bdVaJa KINfj sc-kjoXOD fVfqaX" data-testid="icon:story"></i><i
                color="3" size="18" class="sc-bdVaJa fDMFeQ sc-cHGsZl gxNxeT" data-testid="icon:arrow-up"></i></div>
        <div class="sc-kIPQKe kyHxVW"></div>
    </div>
</div>

*Card description*
<div class="sc-jTzLTM bBEgKU">
    <div class="sc-fYiAbW erRKGE">
        <div class="sc-gHboQg cTinVM">Status</div>
        <div class="sc-cMljjf jnweIx" tabindex="0">
            <div data-testid="select:status" class="sc-jAaTju kMAIqY">
                <div color="backlog" class="sc-eilVRo kvGNcT">
                    <div>Backlog</div><i size="18" class="sc-bdVaJa RfveL" data-testid="icon:chevron-down"></i>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <button class="sc-bwzfXH hHoJg"><i size="24" color="#42526E" class="sc-bdVaJa fuyACr"
                data-testid="icon:close"></i></button>
    </div>
</div>

**TEST CASES REQUEST**
I want you to create a test in Cypress syntax for each of the following use cases:
1) As a user, I should be able to move an issue to update its status.
Remember that I want only the code, I don’t need ANY explanation.

**OBSERVATIONS**
Url is https://jira.ivorreic.com/project/board
Wait 15 seconds after the page loads.
Move the card 100 px to the right.
Before moving, click on the card and assert its status, then, return to home by clicking on the close button.
After moving, click on the card again and assert that its status has changed.

-------

use data-testid to reference the card, the class is not unique

-------

didn't work either, get card, then, by its content "Try dragging issues to different columns to transition their status."


-------

trigger should also pass the contains


-------

The mouse movement isn't working, try another way
