**CONTEXT**
Answer like a software engineer.
I have the HTML below and I want you to create an E2E test case for it using Cypress syntax. The answer must be ONLY
code, you don’t need to explain it.

**CODE EXPLANATION**
The code ahead is an HTML fragment of an application very similar to Jira.

**CODE**
*Search Button*
<div class="sc-tilXH jrvNAG"><i size="22" class="sc-bdVaJa eUCbpK" data-testid="icon:search"></i>
    <div class="sc-hEsumM jftKLf">Search issues</div>
</div>

*Search Input*
<div class="sc-kpOJdX bYAXKl sc-eMigcr fOaoty"><input placeholder="Search issues by summary, description..."
        class="sc-dxgOiQ HrhWu" value=""></div>

*Search Result*
<div class="sc-dTdPqK ipOwpR"></div>

*Card on Search Result*
<div class="sc-jVODtj kSPHKR"><i color="task" size="25" class="sc-bdVaJa lhYezB sc-kjoXOD bTEsIL"
        data-testid="icon:task"></i>
    <div class="sc-kUaPvJ cqXKaV">
        <div class="sc-giadOv gJnbDa">This is an issue of type: Task.</div>
        <div class="sc-fONwsr kpdcqz">task-1776146</div>
    </div>
</div>

*Error message*
<div class="sc-hmXxxW jzsbtO">We couldn't find anything matching your search</div>

**TEST CASES REQUEST**
I want you to create a test in Cypress syntax for each of the following use cases:
1) As a user, I should be able to search for an issue.
2) As a user I should see an error message when searching for a card that doesn't exist
Remember that I want only the code, I don’t need ANY explanation.

**OBSERVATIONS**
Url is https://jira.ivorreic.com/project/board
Wait 15 seconds after the page loads.
Search for 'This is an issue of type' first, then for wasd
Wait 10s after searching.
Don't need to click on anything to search, as you type the cards will be filtered.
After typing, verify if the card is on the result
Both test cases can be done on the same test

-----------------

You missed clicking on the search button, it can be on beforeEach section

-----------------

use testid to get the search button

-----------------

there are two with this same testid, get the first one

-----------------

get input by its placeholder, as there are more elements with this id
