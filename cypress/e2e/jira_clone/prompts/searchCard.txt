**CONTEXT**
Answer like a software engineer.
I have the HTML below and I want you to create an E2E test case for it using Cypress syntax. The answer must be ONLY
code, you don’t need to explain it.

**CODE EXPLANATION**
The code ahead is the HTML demonstration of an application very similar to Jira. The following HTML fragments represent a card on the Kanban board, and after clicking, the card description. The status appears after clicking on it.

**CODE**
*Search*
<div class="sc-kpOJdX bYAXKl sc-kTUwUJ bLDwTk"><i size="15" class="sc-bdVaJa beMSwS sc-ckVGcZ kziXxR"
        data-testid="icon:search"></i><input class="sc-dxgOiQ fIePHj" value=""></div>

*Board*
<div class="sc-hrWEMg efIbEb">
    ...
</div>

*Card*
<div class="sc-kPVwWT eYJELZ">
    <p class="sc-kfGgVZ duybNU">This is an issue of type: Task.</p>
    <div class="sc-esjQYD DdvSq">
        <div><i color="task" size="18" class="sc-bdVaJa kvCxvD sc-kjoXOD bTEsIL" data-testid="icon:task"></i><i
                color="4" size="18" class="sc-bdVaJa fDMFeQ sc-cHGsZl fuuzHm" data-testid="icon:arrow-up"></i></div>
        <div class="sc-kIPQKe kyHxVW"></div>
    </div>
</div>

**TEST CASES REQUEST**
I want you to create a test in Cypress syntax for each of the following use cases:
1) As a user, I should be able to search for a card.
Remember that I want only the code, I don’t need ANY explanation.

**OBSERVATIONS**
Url is https://jira.ivorreic.com/project/board
Wait 15 seconds after the page loads.
 Search for 'This is an issue of type'.
Wait 1s after searching.
After searching, verify if the card is in the board. Use a contains in board id
Don't need to click in anything to search, as you type the cards will be filtered.
